By Nehemiah Madahana.

## Description

This simple Restaurant CLI app built using python enables users to access and modify data in a table. It also allows them to sort through the tables and data in order to present a clearer picture of the data.

## Features

- A CLI menu to enable users to access the data and modify it.

- Persistence of data through a database.

## How to Use

### Requirements

- A computer.
- [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) version 3.18.3 or higher.

#### Check if You Have Python

Run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see this if python is installed:

![menu](/assets/menu.png)

### Options

#### Table Managers

The methods in this section are also applicable to Shift Manager (Option 2 on the main menu) and Worker Manager (Option 3 on the main menu).

1. To exit type "0" and press Enter:

![exit](/assets/exit.png)

This will exit the CLI and you'll have to re-do step 5 of the installation Process.

2. To add a new row to Restaurant:

- First type "1" into the terminal. This takes you to the Restaurant Manager.Each model has its own manager and the menu is similar to this one:

![restaurant_manager](/assets/restaurant_manager.png)

- From here you can add, update or delete a row from the database table associated with the manager, in this case the table is restaurants. You can also return to the main menu from this point by typing "0", but we are currently interested in adding a new Restaurant to the table, therefore we type "1":

![add_restaurant_1](/assets/add_restaurant_1.png)

- This causes the program to prompt us for more information about the Restaurant we are trying to add:

![add_restaurant_1](/assets/add_restaurant_1.png)

- Fill in the information  required  and you will get a success message:

![add_restaurant_2](/assets/add_restaurant_2.png)

- To check if the data has been persisted. Type "4" into the terminal:

![success_restaurant](/assets/success_restaurant.png)

3. Now let's update this restaurant.

- Enter the Restaurant Manager by typing "1", then type "2" to enter the update menu:

![update_menu](/assets/update_menu.png)

- There are two ways to update a database entry for every Manager: by name and by id. Since we can easily remember a name as opposed to remembering an id, let's use the restaurant's name:

![update_restaurant_1](/assets/update_restaurant_1.png)

- Fill in the required details then press Enter:

![update_restaurant_2](/assets/update_restaurant_2.png)

- To confirm the data has been persisted we again type "4" then hit Enter.

![update_restaurant_3](/assets/update_restaurant_3.png)

4. Let's delete the restaurant.

- Enter the restaurant manager by first typing "1", then enter the delete menu by typing "2" and hitting Enter.

![delete_restaurant_1](/assets/delete_restaurant_1.png)

- Here we again have an option to delete either by name or id. Now that we know the restaurant's id, let's try that path. Choose the second option by typing "2" and hitting enter, then input the restaurant's id which is "1".

![delete_restaurant_2](/assets/delete_restaurant_2.png)

- We get a confirmation message, but just to be sure, let's list all restaurants (Option 4 on the main menu)

![delete_restaurant_3](/assets/delete_restaurant_3.png)

- Woohoo! There are no restaurants in the table. It worked!

#### Find by Id

What if you knew a restaurant's Id and wanted to find more about it? Look no further than the Find by Id option.

- Find restaurant by Id (Option 5 on the main menu) lets you find  a restaurant by its Id.

- Find shift by Id (Option 7 on the main menu) lets you find a shift by its Id.

- Find worker by Id (Option 9 on the main menu) lets you find a worker by their Id.

Create a restaurant using the instructions from the segment on Table Managers above, then from the main menu:

1. Enter "5" into the input field.

![find_res_by_id_1](/assets/find_res_by_id_1.png)

2. Input the id of the restaurant in this case "1":

![find_res_by_id_2](/assets/find_res_by_id_2.png)

and Voil√†!

#### More

You're probaly wondering about the More option(*). Well, let's find out what it does.

![more_1](/assets/more_1.png)

The More option enables us to extract relationship data from the tables

The queries are generally structured in this way: Get *many* for *one*.

- Get shifts for restaurant (Option 1), can be said as "Get *all* the shifts associated with the **restaurant Id** that I pass in.

- Get workers for restaurant (Option 2), can be said as "Get *all* the workers associated with the **restaurant Id** that I pass in.

- Get workers for shift (Option 3), can be said as "Get *all* the workers associated with the **shift Id** that I pass in.

- Get shifts for worker (Option 4), can be said as "Get *all* the shifts associated with the **worker Id** that I pass in.

Lets see it in action, We'll use Option 1 (Get shifts for restaurant).

1. We navigate to the More Menu by typing "*" into the terminal.

![more_1](/assets/more_1.png)

2. We select the First Option (Get shifts for restaurant) by typing in "1" then hitting Enter.

![more_2](/assets/more_2.png)

3. We enter the restaurant Id, in this case "1" and get the result. (I'd added a new restaurant and some shifts to help demonstarate the query behaviour more clearly)
